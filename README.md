# Calvin's Coffee Roast - Email Notification Microservice

A simple microservice to process and send coffee order confirmation emails and promotional announcements. Built with Express.js and Nodemailer, designed to be called by the main ordering system via HTTP POST.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This service is hosted on a free Render instance, which may enter a sleep state after a few minutes of inactivity. If the service is idle, users may experience a short delay while it spins back up. When ready, a request to the base URL will return: "Calvin's Microservice is Running"

## Live Production Instance

Hosted with Render at:  

- BASE URL:`https://calvins-coffee-roast.onrender.com`

## Overview

This microservice receives HTTP POST requests at `/api/notify` containing an order ID or Member ID, then sends a confirmation email to the customer confirming their coffee purchase or a promotional promotional announcement email. It is stateless and designed for quick synchronous processing.

## Features

- Accepts POST requests with JSON payload containing `orders/orderId` and `/members/memberId`.
- Sends a hardcoded confirmation email for demonstration purposes.
- CORS enabled for public requests.
- Logs incoming requests with timestamps, origins, and IP addresses.
- Easy to extend with real email provider credentials.
- Returns JSON `{ "status": "sent" }` on success.
- Data validation returning `{ error: "invalid request" }` missing or non-numeric IDs.

## API Overview

This service listens for POST requests and sends hardcoded email responses for testing/demo purposes.

## How to **Request** Data from Microservice A

User must send an HTTP `POST` request to one of the service's endpoints, passing a valid numeric ID as a **URL parameter**. I have provided different ways to test it. Through a static HTML page and through a raw http file.

### Example: Sending Order Confirmation

```bash
curl -X POST https://calvins-coffee-roast.onrender.com/api/notify/orders/:orderId
```

Response:

```json
{
  "status": "Confirmation Email Sent Successfully",
  "preview": "https://ethereal.email/message/EMAIL_PREVIEW_LINK"
}
```

### Example: Sending Promotional Announcement

```bash
curl -X POST https://calvins-coffee-roast.onrender.com/api/notify/members/:memberId
```

Response:

```json
{
  "status": "Promotional Announcement Sent Successfully",
  "preview": "https://ethereal.email/message/EMAIL_PREVIEW_LINK"
}
```

## How to **Receive** Data from This Microservice

The microservice responds synchronously with a JSON payload in the body of the response. Clients should inspect the status and optionally the preview field, which provides a link to view the generated email via Ethereal Email.

## Input Validation

- `orderId` and `memberId` **must be numeric**.
- Missing or non-numeric values result in HTTP `400`:

### Example Error Response

```json
{
  "error": "invalid orderId"
}
```

```json
{
  "error": "invalid memberId"
}
```

## Mitigation Plan

**Teammate:** Calvin Trombley

### Microservice Status: **Completed**

- Both email previews working via Ethereal
- All required endpoints and validation implemented
- Two types of testing provided: HTML testing and raw http testing

### If Teammate Can‚Äôt Access It

- They can notify me on any time before **Monday, May 19st**
- I‚Äôll be available to help on MS Teams during the weekend between **9am‚Äì9pm PST**
- If needed, I can provide a fallback local version of the service or troubleshoot Render deployment.

### Optional Repo Access, if teammate prefers to run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dracospitfire/confirmation-email.git
cd calvins-coffee-roast-microservice
npm install
npm start
```

### Assumptions & Notes

- This service sends **mock emails** for demo purposes using `nodemailer.createTestAccount()` via Ethereal.
- In production, swap the transporter config to use a real SMTP provider like Mailgun, Gmail, or SendGrid.
- The microservice does **not** persist orders ‚Äî order and member data is hardcoded or must be provided by the caller.
